# QVNTVS
* **QVANTVS** is an open-source software that can calculate the **wavefunctions and the corresponding energy levels** inside potential quantum wells*

* *QVNTVS solves **Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation** for finite-potential wells composed of different semiconductor materials (barrier vs. well, heterojunction) using both **Finite-Difference numerical method***

* *The main purpose of this project is **facilitating the modeling process of quantum wells that are to be used in LEDs or LASERs.***

* *This project is created by **Barbaros Şair** while working at **UNAM (National Nanotechnology Research Centre, Turkey) as an undergraduate researcher in Demir Research Group** focusing on **Colloidal Quantum Well LEDs.***
