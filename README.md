# QVNTVS
Finite Heterojunction Potential Well Solver for Semiconductors
QVANTVS is an open-source software that can calculate the wavefunctions and the corresponding energy levels inside finite-potential quantum wells

QVNTVS solves Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation for finite-potential wells composed of different semiconductor materials (barrier vs. well, heterojunction) using both Finite-Difference numerical method and transcendental graphical-analytical method.

The main purpose of this project is facilitating the modeling process of quantum wells that are to be used in LEDs or LASERs.

This project is created by Barbaros Şair while working at UNAM (National Nanotechnology Research Centre, Turkey) as an undergraduate researcher in Demir Research Group focusing on Colloidal Quantum Well LEDs.
